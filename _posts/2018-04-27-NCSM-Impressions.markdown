## What I've Been Thinking About
I've been traveling around the state of Ohio talking to teachers about how to improve math class. I demonstrate simple ways to spark curiosity, encourage productive struggle, and plan for meaningful discourse. Most teachers are eager for tips and techniques and ready to try them out.

They love that we do math problems together.

At the end the most common question I get is, "Where do you find these great math problems?"

Everyone wants the magic bullet. Dan Meyer's Three-Act tasks, Fawn Nguyen's Visual Patterns, Christopher Danielson's Which One Doesn't Belong, Graham Fletcher's XXX, and on and on.

What's been bothering me is that I don't believe great tasks are the solution.

Great teaching is the solution! The tasks are just a tool in our giant tool box.

## Enter Dan Meyer at NCTM

Apparently Dan's been wondering the same thing. Why does a task like Barbie Bungie which virtually every teacher seems to love sometimes fail?

In typical Dan Meyer fashion he walks you right through all the key points.

## The hazards of paper
What happens when you try and script the lesson? Can you make Barbie Bungie into a worksheet?

Here's the problem if you make a student worksheet for students, it's easy to fall into the trap of providing too much information.

If you purposefully left out some key information during the launch of the task. How are you going to provide that on a worksheet?

The key point is that the organic discussions that arise in class are so much more valuable in keeping student engagement high and allowing students the freedom to problem solve.

Did you put a graph on the worksheet for students to fill out? If so, you've turned the non-routine into the routine of plotting points. Who decided which variables are assigned to each axis?
