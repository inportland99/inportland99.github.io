Cellphones, iPads, computers, game consoles have profoundly changed the lives of our children. These devices and their apps are designed to suck all of our attention. Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, and others have built their entire business models around grabbing and keeping our attention.

There are some positives to being able to connect to friends and family online and learn from online videos. But, there is also the potential for these devices to become addicting as we continually consume messages, videos, photos, etc.

The original intent of these technologies was to make it easier for us to create, solve problems, and be more effective.

Our kids need to start becoming PRODUCERS of content, not just CONSUMERS of content.

* Instead of playing videos games, use your imagination to CREATE video games.
* Instead of watching videos, learn to MAKE and edit videos that educate and inspire.
* Instead of using electronics blindly, LEARN how the electronics really work
* Instead a buying a new gadget, DESIGN and BUILD something from scratch that solves your wants or needs.

Math Plus Academy camps offer students a change to be PRODUCERS and not just consumers.

3D Printing & Modeling - learn to design in 3D and print real models
Maker Camp - design and build engineering solutions to real problems
Coding 101 & Video Game Design - make animations and video games from scratch
LEGO Robotics - build and program robots to do automated tasks

Every child has an active imagination, what they sometimes lack are the tools, guidance, and knowledge to start turning their ideas into reality.

There's still time to try out a camp that will help your child learn to use technology, not just sit and consume it.
